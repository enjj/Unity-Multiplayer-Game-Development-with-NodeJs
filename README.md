# Unity-Multiplayer-Game-Development-with-NodeJs

- In this project I've learned how to develop a multiplayer game that allows for real-time game play.

- I've discovered how to create your own multiplayer game with a dedicated server driven by NodeJs. 

- Some of the key takeaways from this project include learning how to create a server authoritative multiplayer game. 

- As well as create a dedicated server from the ground up.

- I've  also learned how to use Nodejs and how to work with WebSockets. 

- I've learned cool stuffs about synchronizing A.I. over the network in real time. By doing this project, I have a multiplayer game template and you can use to make something simple, or something as complex as a massive multiplayer online game or MMO.

- All contributions are welcome.
